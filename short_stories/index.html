  - title: Toy Story 1
    description: I remember not having many toys in my childhood years. Perhaps I did, but they just left no impression on me. My parents are not the kind who would restrict their kids’ need for toys and entertainment, but they never really quite understood what I wanted, especially my mom.

  - title: Pieces
    description: Two children sat in the middle of a small, dark room, with only each other, the small yellow bulb on the ceiling and a few insects as company. The wooden floor was dusty, with a few dislocated boards. The room had little in it but for the jigsaw puzzle the two children had laid onto the ground…

    description: My mission for that day was simple. I woke up at 7 on a heavy snow day, the horrifying view of whiteness on the window greeted me. However, the true horror lay beneath the whiteness – my objective for that day…
