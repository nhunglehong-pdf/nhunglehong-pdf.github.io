  - title: Toy Story 1
    description: I remember not having many toys in my childhood years. Perhaps I did, but they just left no impression on me. My parents are not the kind who would restrict their kids’ need for toys and entertainment, but they never really quite understood what I wanted, especially my mom. It was out of the question to ask Dad for any toys because he was always being busy when I was little, so he wouldn’t know what it was or have the time to go buy it…

  - title: Toy Story 2
    description: I remember not having many toys in my childhood years. I don’t have many memories playing with toys I liked that were mine, but there’s one, my absolute favorite, even until this day. It’s a gift from my aunt from her trip to Japan when I was four or five, and it has remained as the only stuffed animal in my bed since then. She is a cream colored bunny with wide black eyes and a cute little white fluffy tail…

  - title: Legend
    description: There’s no doubt that I’m my grandpa’s favorite. He has never said it, but everyone else has. I’m his oldest grandchild and the one he spent the most time taking care of. I was born when he was still in his prime and exhilarated to finally have a grandchild. I basically lived with my grandparents the first three years of my life because Mom and Dad worked all day and I couldn’t go to kindergarten yet…

  - title: An afterthought
    description: It is 2:21 A.M. the day of the deadline as I’m sitting on my bed, unthoughtful and unreflective, typing and deleting streams of consciousness. I’m not really sure what to share and what not to, or whether I have anything to share at all…

  - title: Maze of mirror
    description: I opened my eyes to the sound of knocking on the mirrors. I was trapped, yet again. The room apparently had shrunk and the mirror moved close. As a result, the fluorescent lights kept bouncing off the mirror and lit up the entire room, making the room both pale and bright…

  - title: Do not go gentle into that goodnight
    description: Seen at 12:04 AM. Eyes locked to the white screen, I sighed. It was a serene afternoon: no scorching sun, only breezy wind delivering tender sleepiness. The smell of paint and fresh clothes was overwhelmed by the monotonous lemon scent room cleaner mixed with the strong odor of morphine…

  - title: Mission - Valentine Discount
    description: My mission for that day was simple. I woke up at 7 on a heavy snow day, the horrifying view of whiteness on the window greeted me. However, the true horror lay beneath the whiteness – my objective for that day…
