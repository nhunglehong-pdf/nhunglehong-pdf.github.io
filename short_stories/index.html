  - title: Toy Story 1
    description: I remember not having many toys in my childhood years. Perhaps I did, but they just left no impression on me. My parents are not the kind who would restrict their kids’ need for toys and entertainment, but they never really quite understood what I wanted, especially my mom. It was out of the question to ask Dad for any toys because he was always being busy when I was little, so he wouldn’t know what it was or have the time to go buy it…

  - title: Toy Story 2
    description: I remember not having many toys in my childhood years. I don’t have many memories playing with toys I liked that were mine, but there’s one, my absolute favorite, even until this day. It’s a gift from my aunt from her trip to Japan when I was four or five, and it has remained as the only stuffed animal in my bed since then. She is a cream colored bunny with wide black eyes and a cute little white fluffy tail…

  - title: An afterthought
    description: It is 2:21 A.M. the day of the deadline as I’m sitting on my bed, unthoughtful and unreflective, typing and deleting streams of consciousness. I’m not really sure what to share and what not to, or whether I have anything to share at all…

  - title: Pieces
    description: Two children sat in the middle of a small, dark room, with only each other, the small yellow bulb on the ceiling and a few insects as company. The wooden floor was dusty, with a few dislocated boards. The room had little in it but for the jigsaw puzzle the two children had laid onto the ground…

    description: My mission for that day was simple. I woke up at 7 on a heavy snow day, the horrifying view of whiteness on the window greeted me. However, the true horror lay beneath the whiteness – my objective for that day…

  - title: Do not go gentle into that good night
    description: <i>Seen at 12:04 AM.</i><br>Eyes locked to the white screen, I sighed. It was a serene afternoon, no scorching sun, only breezy wind delivering tender sleepiness. The smell of paint and fresh clothes was overwhelmed by the monotonous lemon scent room cleaner...

  - title: The bra
    description: I remember the first time I wore a bra. I arrived home from school in the fourth grade, and my mom silently handed me a white cloth to put on beneath my shirt. Right after the day I had bawled my eyes out to her, coming back from my daily 6pm cycling ride around the city...
