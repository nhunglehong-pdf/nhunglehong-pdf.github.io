The day I deleted my old anthology –  
A whole file, 49 pieces –  
With the same fingertip I prolonged the press on the Backspace key  
As I used to wipe my bitter tears.  
“Oh, what folly did I commit?”  

The day I deleted my old anthology  
I smeared my most flamboyant streak  
Not the relieving sense that men achieve  
When they shave off their hirsute beards –  
What I found was the swelling of fear  
Choking my bosom  
“Oh, what folly did I commit?”  

I ended up scavenging the Recycle Bin  
Restore! Everything! – for  
The day I deleted my old anthology
