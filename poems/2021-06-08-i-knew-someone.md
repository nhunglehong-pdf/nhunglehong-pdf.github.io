i once met this man who travelled.  
his sleeves smelled like damp undergrowth, airplane exhaust, and  
cheap energy drinks.  
inside he held a million strangers’ stories  
that he’d pull out  
like a magician’s cards.  
this was what he said:  

he said he was a balloon  
among a myriad of others at some town fair  
with the string broken.  
from above circus tents looked like umbrellas and the people ants.  
he boasted about gliding on clouds  
tasting their cotton sweetness  
about how stars looked better scattered on an airplane’s window.  

i met him again today  
although his sleeves were stained with cigarette smoke, blood stain,  
and  
maybe alcohol.  
they still hid pieces from strangers  
only now they were all eulogies, and  
suicide notes.  
his face only crumpled like a worn and creased world map so i read  
in his eyes:  

he said he was a balloon  
among a myriad of others at some town fair  
with the string broken  
and no one chased after him.  
because  
clouds didn’t taste so sweet after all,  
they were only condensed water.  
if you lay on them you would  
fall right  
through.
