This evening   
Nobody home  
As usual  
So I eat out  
Ready to try something new   
This time maybe my last   
At Restaurant O'Feel  
A nice warm place  
Extensive menu  
Every emotion  
Afraid to tranquil.  
'What you want' they ask,  
'What your worst' I say,  
'That will take a while'  
'Alright I will wait.'  
Then I look around  
As the guests arrive  
Alone or together  
Giving their orders  
Mostly pleasure  
Peacefulness or joy;  
Others wanted adventures  
More intense their choices.  
Down on them I look  
For those thoughtless creatures don't  
Or pretend not to  
Know  

Out there  
Never a place  
Where, by a perfect bond,  
Feelings are vital  
And Life emotive.  
I know I must be feeling arrogant, but I don't.  
And I wait for my dish  
As they finish their servings  
Of artificial feelings  
Their faces go blank, their eyes wander   
I know  
They are trying to grasp what just happened  

And cope with what is to come-  
What is waiting  

Out there-  
So wide a gap.

I know I should feel pity for them, but I don't  
Then  
As I patiently wait long hours for my dish  
Something strange happens  
I fall in love, again  
I did not fail that competition  
My cat did not die  
The mob don't hate me  
Hirers don't reject me  
I did not say those words, ever  
A million scenes invade my imagination.  
I know I should feel joy, but I don't.  

Here is but a false milieu,  
Their dishes fake and meager  
Against the world  
Out there.  
Restaurant O'Feel  
A shop for trying out Feelings  
Without suffering or enjoying Life  
Or a fleeting sanctuary  
From too much of Life  
Then  
As I wait long hours for my dish  
Impatiently, something strange happens  
The roof cracks and falls down  
On restaurant-goers  
The kitchen combusts  
Screams and the smell of blood fill the air  
Along that of burning flesh  
But my table is spared.  
In the cold misty air  
Out there  
I'm the lone survivor  
And justice undone.  
I know I should have some feelings, but I don't.  
Then I know  
My dish  
The worst of Restaurant O'Feel  
Has been well served.
