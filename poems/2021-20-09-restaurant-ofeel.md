This evening

Nobody home

As usual

So I eat out

Ready to try something new

This time maybe my last

At Restaurant O'Feel.

A nice warm place

Extensive menu

Every emotion

Afraid to tranquil.

'What you want' they ask,

'What your worst' I say,

'That will take a while'

'Alright I will wait.'

Then I look around

As the guests arrive

Alone or together

Giving their orders

Mostly pleasure

Peacefulness or joy;

Others wanted adventures

More intense their choices.

Down on them I look

For those thoughtless creatures don't

Or pretend not to

Know


Out there

Never a place

Where, by a perfect bond,

Feelings are vital

And Life emotive.

I know I must be feeling arrogant, but I don't.

And I wait for my dish

As they finish their servings

Of artificial feelings

Their faces go blank, their eyes wander

I know

They are trying to grasp what just happened


And cope with what is to come-

What is waiting


Out there-

So wide a gap.


I know I should feel pity for them, but I don't

Then

As I patiently wait long hours for my dish

Something strange happens

I fall in love, again

I did not fail that competition

My cat did not die

The mob don't hate me

Hirers don't reject me

I did not say those words, ever

A million scenes invade my imagination.

I know I should feel joy, but I don't.


Here is but a false milieu,

Their dishes fake and meager

Against the world

Out there.

Restaurant O'Feel

A shop for trying out Feelings

Without suffering or enjoying Life

Or a fleeting sanctuary

From too much of Life

Then

As I wait long hours for my dish

Impatiently, something strange happens

The roof cracks and falls down

On restaurant-goers

The kitchen combusts

Screams and the smell of blood fill the air

Along that of burning flesh

But my table is spared.

In the cold misty air

Out there

I'm the lone survivor

And justice undone.

I know I should have some feelings, but I don't.

Then I know

My dish

The worst of Restaurant O'Feel

Has been well served.
