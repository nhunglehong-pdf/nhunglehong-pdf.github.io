  To myself, my best friend and whoever out there struggling with self

dearie honey, lovely dove,  
under listless trees you doze  
trotting in trouble  
just for a miracle  
lolling and laughing and going and gasping.  
all shouldas and couldas and wouldas and buddhas  
trampling tramps who mixes and mucks  
while toiling and tripping in pearly mud  
the mud of mice and the mud of men  
repugnantly moral and morally repugnant  
affixing your crosses to lofty temples  
that reek of money and the basest needs  
donning a crown of holy brambles  
enlightening heathens and peasants alike  
yet fail to love yourself.  
dearie honey, lovely dove  
let go of your empty holes
