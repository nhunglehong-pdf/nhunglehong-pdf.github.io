May time speak of anything     
But how it dampens the sparks   
May absence bring anything  
But the pains and aches of heart  
For all that I can say  
As time and mind decay  
The bonds one forge in the name of hope  
Are the seeds that will grow on sides of the slope  
Downhill the trees of mind would cast their shadows  
And with time, dead leaves would cover the meadow   
The meadow of the mind  
The valley of the heart  
Covered in leaves, long dead  
From a time that one long dread   

Far and wide spread the wings of the treacherous  
As hearts are made of paper  
Not gold, alas, and love  
Is not as perennial as we hope  
For they wither, and wilt, and die  
And as our hopes take to the sky  
The peregrine would fly and catch  
And devour on our hearts   
Alas, ‘tis the evanescence of heartspeak!
