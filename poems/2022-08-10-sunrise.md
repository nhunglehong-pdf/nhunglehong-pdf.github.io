Wandering on a road unpaved.  
Alone and broken, against the wind I braved.  
Lost was my passion for the journey ahead.  
I was getting sucked into the land of the dead.  
Blind I was to color, as I was to love.  
I prayed for someone to be sent from above.  

'twas then, with the east wind came Eos.  
Looking at her I went in a state of chaos.  
For she was a rose dearest to god.  
At her gracefulness, the swans felt awed.  
I looked at the land, barren and infertile,  
There now blossomed an iris, unspoiled and sterile.  

Together, I knew, we would make a whole.  
For in her I saw, a reflection of my soul.  
And so, I proposed her to be my half.  
For the journey that lies ahead.  
From there on - our paths were one.  
As we wandered towards the rising sun.
