A white dash of summer  
caught the apple tree in the midst of deflorescing.  
The silvery sound of petals breaking  
paled painlessly, in this air of summery amber  
That felt sticky, thick, and heavy with nature’s scents;  
its sweet golden gush touched every sense.  
 
Another stroke of summer,  
and Time passed before me like a lens.  
I looked through it, amidst the apple trees of that summer,  
and found a boy  
Whose innocent eyes rolled with joy  
as he nibbled the fruit’s soft swellings of juice.  
I now nibbled the bitter wizened petals that fell.
