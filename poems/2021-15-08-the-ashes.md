Seven years before long  
The king that I was once  
Bounced the wave and bladed the wind  
The storms with gigantic arms  
Behold before the little king  
The folks they used to be  
Bowing down and kissing the earth  
With their heads above alert  
To follow the little king  
Up the air and down the ocean  
Went the folks to fetch the gifts  
Of the things that most precious  
To bring up, to meet the king  
Now passes that seven years     
Leaving the filth, the lust  
Leaving behind what once was searched  
With the ashes of the little king
