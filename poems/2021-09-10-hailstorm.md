So one night I woke up and clutched my blanket.  
You know, it’s one of those ones again, when the late midnight chill creeps in  
and soak into the breath of dead night.  
Sometimes night would walk across my raining dreams,  
hoping to lay a frosted touch upon its outline.  
So a hailstorm came down, so it came down  
And turned my world upside down.  

So across my eyes, the darkness flashed  
I know, it’s one of those ones again, when out our early days come flowing  
and linger on the threshold of dawn.  
Always there’s a warm golden spring  
that sadly, wouldn’t even start.  
So a hailstorm came down, so it came down  
And turned my sun into clouds.
