Three months ago I received her message:


“Do you want to play with this pussy?


Meow…”


Prostitute. That went without saying. These days it is common to receive such cajoling messages from prostitutes sometimes. I reckoned their business must have been thriving with the popularity of social media and communication devices, though I wondered what type of men would become their customers. They must be miserable folks, in some manner. Like politicians. But for the sake of reputation, I doubt if any politician would forget to repress their desire to have a ‘national’ affair. Those politicians exist like cicadas – everyone can hear the powerful echo of their voice, yet nobody knows what they look like in their barest state.


“I can do incredible things for you with my little paws,” continued the message.


I admit I have somewhat more freedom (than those politicians) to be entertained by prostitutes, but whether I would derive any pleasure from doing so is another matter. By-the-by, I wouldn’t. Too busy for prostitutes. A busy man as I am would just ignore the message right away, but something captured my attention, something uncanny about the message.


It came from an existing contact in my phone directory. Name: Cat. Phone number: Not shown. Only a blank contact named “Cat”.


I stared at my phone for a while, hesitant to ask “Who is this?” But the moment I started typing, there is an update, “ You can’t reply to this conversation.”


I wondered who this woman was and why she did this to me on a Monday morning, but I stopped thinking about her for the same reason that it was a Monday morning.


The beginning of a new week means something to many people. I know the weekly loop didn’t intrinsically mean anything, but a Monday morning meant something to me. I didn’t want to mess up the entire week. The task checklist that day said I had to read through piles of paperwork at the office in the morning, attend a meeting, then get dressed in formal clothes for a funeral at 3 p.m. After the funeral, I would have to go paying my electricity bill; I had procrastinated it for so long that they called me and threatened that there would be a cutoff.


The funeral was of an old friend of mine (we went to college together). He was a decent man; I regretted he died so young. Back then he was the type that never got attention from other people. His steps were always too light that he could simply travel around unnoticed like a phantom, or a cat. Thinking about cats, I shivered a bit.


Then his wife saw me.


“You’re finally here!” I thought she wouldn’t be able to recognize me, for we had only met several times long ago. Tears cascaded from her eyes as she continued speaking, “It was a horrific car accident. I told him earlier that the weather was too bad it was almost an omen, but he insisted on going fishing. For what? He didn’t even die thunderstruck. His car crashed into a tree when he was trying to avoid a wild-running pig on the street. A pig! Can you even imagine that?”


I really did imagine, and I chuckled a bit when I did so: Even at the guy’s funeral, people care more about a pig than about him. I immediately straightened my face and uttered the appropriate thing to say.


“I am very sorry to hear that, Madam. My deepest condolences…”


She interrupted me with a sudden hug. Her soggy face was against my chest. She squeezed me hard, and I could feel her nails caressing and pressing onto my back. While it turned me on a little, the situation was awkward. I felt I had to get out of there. The widow was observing me as I left. I didn’t take a last look at the coffin. I thought the deceased man looked much more cheerful the last time I saw him than he did then, having deceased.


I didn’t pay my electricity bill and headed home right after the funeral instead. The weather was indeed unfavorable, and I was tired. While I was changing out of the suit I wore at the funeral, the power went out. That was not unexpected. It just didn’t come at the right time (if there was a right time for such a thing). In complete darkness, I groped for my phone. I hadn’t checked my phone since morning, so it is not surprising to see it was inundated with notifications. A few were from Cat; she texted roughly before the time the funeral happened.


“I’m in a playful mood today. Do you want to come round?

Oh, I’m already purring in excitement.”


I started to think there was some sort of underlying meaning behind her texts. It might be a plea. I felt apologetic, and even sympathetic at the chances, but what can I do?


“You have been very quiet. Has another cat got your tongue?” she seemed somewhat uneasy even when she was joking.


I was perplexed. Everything about this woman was curious. First, she wanted me to answer her questions, but blocked me from replying — she could not have both. Second, she was an existing contact in my phone, yet, her phone number, it was not there. She was something in the middle.


In my head, I tried to match random female heads with a feline body, like a sphinx. Cat must have borne many resemblances to the mythical Sphinx, one of which was that we knew she couldn’t have existed, but couldn’t help getting convinced otherwise.


After that time Cat never bothered me again. My interest in such a sunken mystery did not persist long. It was not until one day when another prostitute tried to sext me that I started to notice: the name “Cat” was no longer an existing contact in my directory. I wasn’t the one who deleted the contact. Although I had no evidence, I knew it was not someone else who did it either. The contact just vanished. I didn’t question anymore. I just so assumed she’s dead.
