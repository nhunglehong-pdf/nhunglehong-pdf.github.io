<i>for those left behind</i>

it's because of you  
and...  
it's because of me  
it's because it happened to rain that day  
because he had to go to classes even during school break  
because his backpack was heavy with workbooks  
because it was a hot and humid summer day  
because the drizzles overshadowed bright sunshine for so long  
because he fell into a slump and didn't get the grades he wanted  
because the competition for the college entrance exams was too intense  
because he couldn't draw to his heart's content  
because his friends didn't see him for who he was  
because his parents put their selfish desires before his feelings  

maybe...  
it's because he started to like...  
the rain that he'd hated so much  
it's because  
no one was able to teach him how to love himself  
it's because of everything and everyone  
... but it's the fault of no one  
and it's especially not his fault.
