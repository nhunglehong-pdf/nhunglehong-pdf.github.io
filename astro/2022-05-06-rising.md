Disclaimer: Take this with a grain of salt. 

**Aries Risings** are constantly overwhelmed and drained by life but that’s why (or because) they try so hard (Pisces in the 12th)

**Taurus Risings** get annoyed and frustrated all the time but they usually just choose to let it go (Aries in the 12th)

**Gemini Risings** would actually love to find someone to settle down with as long as they don't feel chained or suffocated (Taurus in the 12th)

**Cancer Risings** have a way of figuring out everyone’s business but just not letting on that they know (Gemini in the 12th)

**Leo Risings** act like bad bitches but they’re really big babies who need a lot of comfort and reassurance to face the world (Cancer in the 12th)

**Virgo Risings** know they’re amazing at what they do but wouldn’t actually say that out loud because they’d consider that tacky (Leo in the 12th)

**Libra Risings** can be really cranky and grumpy but are also horrified by this and try to hide it so no one will hate them (Virgo in the 12th)

**Sagittarius Risings** laugh and joke so much about traumatic things in their lives that no one knows what their real pain is, including themselves at times (Scorpio in the 12th)

**Capricorn Risings** constantly feel embarrassed and silly in different situations but maintain their poise so well that it doesn’t show (Sagittarius in the 12th)

**Aquarius Risings** say a lot of insightful or sensible things that people tend to brush off and don’t realize are accurate until much later (Capricorn in the 12th)

**Pisces Risings** are capable of having a meltdown, even a breakdown, at any given moment and no one, including them, would know why (Aquarius in the 12th)
