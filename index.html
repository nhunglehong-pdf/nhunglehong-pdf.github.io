            <p>My name is Lê Hồng Nhung. I'm 18-year-old Vietnamese high school student in Singapore. I have the following interests:
            <li>Mathematics (this honestly might be an unrequited love since Maths obviously doesn't like me and makes me cry more than a few times)</li>
                <li>Memes</li>
                <li>Reading and a little bit of writing</li></p>     
                <p><b>my history</b><br>
                    Maybe my posts will have answer to <b>all</b> of your questions as I overshared a lot writing them</p>
